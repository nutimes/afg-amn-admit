## Background

::: {.incremental}
* Seasonality/seasonal variation refers to recurring patterns at specific times of the year. 
&nbsp;
* It has impact on the underlying and immediate factors that drives acute malnutrition (AMN). 
&nbsp;
* It is known that AMN has a seasonal variation, however limited evidence is available to substantiate that.  
  + Stakeholders often rely on assumptions of an AMN seasonal peak during the food security lean season.  
    + Nutrition surveys are routinely timed to coincide with the lean season each year. 
::: 

## Objective

* Understand the seasonal patterns of acute malnutrition and the most common childhood diseases, in order to provide evidence-based inputs for IPC AMN analysis parameters and to inform the timing of nutrition data collection in Afghanistan

## Methods {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column style="text-align: left"}
#### Source of data

* **Fourteen years** of admission data on acute malnutrition into the country's treatment programme
    + Data was provided: 
        - Broken down by severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition cases
            - These were aggregated to form the Global Acute Malnutriton (GAM)
    + Broken down by provinces (all of them)

* Five years of admission data on child diseases
:::
::: {.column style="text-align: left"}

#### Analysis

* **Exploratory (visual) data analysis**: to inspect possible underneath patterns
    + If: 
        - patterns were similar across provinces: 
            - aggregate data as National
    + Otherwise: 
        - Analyse the provinces with distinct patterns as one

* **Time series decomposition**: a **process** of **extracting** the underlying **trend** and **seasonal variation** from the time series

* Current seasonal variation was determined on the basis of the patterns exihibited over the last three years

#### Key messages

+ The level of admissions rose as of September 2021, like never seen before. It reached its highest point in December 2021 with **over 150K cases**. Thereafter, it remained high over time, like never seen before as well. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Question?
What may have hapenned in the 3rd quarter of 2021 and thereafter?

+ Insights from the Nutrition Cluster Coordination Team, following the presentation of preliminary findings, suggest that this is due to the scale-up of programme operations. With changes in government, previously inaccessible areas have become accessible for interventions.
