# Understanding seasonal patterns of acute malnutrition and common childhood diseases in Afghanistan

## Insights from 14 of acute malnutrition and five years of childhood illnesses admission data
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome to this repository!

This repository presents a time series analysis conducted to glean insights into the seasonal variations of acute malnutrition and common childhood illnesses in Afghanistan. The analysis draws on a rich dataset, spanning 14 years of acute malnutrition admissions and five years of admissions for common child illnesses. 

The ultimate objective is to generate evidence-based insights to support the IPC Acute Malnutrition analysis parameters and to guide the optimal timing of nutrition data collection efforts in the country.

This analysis was made possible thanks to the strong collaboration of Afghanistanâ€™s Nutrition Cluster Coordination Team and UNICEF. Their support and insights were instrumental throughout the process.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured in the following way:

  + `data/raw`: data.frames containing admissions over time. Data is reported on a monthly basis, with a reporting rate over 98%. The reporting rate is defined as the number of catchment areas that submitted their reported in a given month, divided by the overall number of catchment areas that are expected to report. 
  + `R/`: some handy user-defined functions for the project.  
  + `scripts/`: A set of `R` scripts used for the analysis.

The project workflow can be implemented simply by running the `script.R` file found in the root directory.

## Reproducibility information
The repository was created in `R` version 4.5.1 This project uses the `{renv}` framework to record `R` package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions used are recorded in `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files in the root project directory. On starting an `R` session in the working directory, run `renv::restore()` to install R package dependencies.

## Data encryption  
This project uses `{cyphr}` to encrypt the raw data that lives in `data-raw/` directory. In order to be able to access and decrypt the encrypted data, the user will need to have created their own personal SSH key and make a request to be added to the project. An easy-to-grasp guide on how to make a request will be found [here](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/cyphr-encryption-demonstration#)
